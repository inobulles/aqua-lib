# aqua-lib

⚠️ This repo has been superseded by language-specific repos, such as [aqua-c](https://github.com/inobulles/aqua-c) for C and [aqua-rs](https://github.com/inobulles/aqua-rs) for Rust.⚠️

The repository for the AQUA standard library.

## Languages

The library is divided into multiple subdirectories for each language it supports. Currently the only two available languages are `c` and `cpp`, but `amber` will be added at some point in the future. `zasm` is a possibility but is not planned for now.
