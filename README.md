# aqua-lib

The repository for the AQUA standard library.

## Languages

The library is divided into multiple subfolders for each language it supports. Currently the only language is `c`, but `amber` will be added at some point in the future. `zasm` is a possibility but is not planned for now, and `c++` might come along if I'm feeling adventurous enough, but it isn't planned either. If you want to use C++ for your AQUA projects, you can use the `c` library.
