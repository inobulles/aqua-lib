# aqua-lib

The repository for the AQUA standard library.

## Languages

The library is divided into multiple subdirectories for each language it supports. Currently the only two available languages are `c` and `cpp`, but `amber` will be added at some point in the future. `zasm` is a possibility but is not planned for now.
